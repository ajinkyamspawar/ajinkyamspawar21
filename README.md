### "Hello World" 😉 
It's Ajinkya Pawar. 
"An Engineer by profession and a Writer at ❤️".

I’m currently working on self project: "name yet to be decided". 

Earlier I worked on Apache PySpark based project "Genre classification and Song data analysis on Spotify tracks dataset". 
This project was for my academic completion of PG-DBDA(CDAC-Pune). We(Team of 4) completed the same project in Panads too, i.e.
in a span of 19 days we successfully completed the project using two different technologies i.e. Apache PySpark and Pandas.
